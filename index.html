   <p>The Excluded Workers Fund is nearing completion and around 13,000 claims have been submitted in Westchester County, of which more than 5,000 were approved, for a total of more than $ 60,000 delivered to beneficiaries, but dozens of undocumented immigrants were not able to apply. Due to the flood of applications, the New York State Department of Labor stopped accepting applications from Friday, October 8, and many applicants were left in limbo despite applying within two weeks of the deadline.

   <p>Pedro Peña, commissioned by the occupational health and safety administration at Don Bosco Workers Inc., (a community organization run by Latino immigrant day laborers and other low-income workers in Port Chester), was instrumental in getting many undocumented immigrants to receive these funds, but it also counts that many did not manage to apply due to the lack of information or the lack of proof to request the aid. "We feel a bittersweet taste when people come and tell us that they did not approve, we feel frustrated because they tell us their stories and we know the pain of those people," says Peña. "Others could not even apply because they do not have their passport up to date, they do not have proof of address, but we have known them for years, it has been very hard not being able to help them."</p>
   <p>Peña assures that it was a lot of work, that people made long lines, and that a lot of people from the organization stayed long hours to attend everyone, "we never told them no, if they did not have a document we would look for a solution, we helped them obtain a copy of their taxes, we help them look for rental receipts or proof of address. We exhausted all the resources to be able to help them all", he affirmed.</p>
